# ✅ Database Update Complete!

## What Was Done:

### 1. Fixed Database Schema
- Updated `residential_leads` table structure to match form submission code
- Changed column names from old schema (owner_name, owner_email, etc.) to new schema (homeowner_name, contact_email, etc.)
- Added missing columns: cleaning_frequency, services_needed, special_requirements, lead_quality

### 2. Created Update Script
- Added `run_db_update.py` to initialize/update database tables
- Script creates both residential_leads and commercial_lead_requests tables
- Shows status and counts for all tables

### 3. Ran Local Update
- Executed update script successfully
- Created tables in local SQLite database
- Verified tables are ready to receive data

## ✅ Status:

**Local Database:**
- ✅ residential_leads table created
- ✅ commercial_lead_requests table created

**Production Database (Render):**
- 🚀 Code deployed automatically via GitHub push
- 📡 Tables will be created when /run-updates is accessed on production
- 🔄 Schema matches insert statements

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### For Production:
1. Visit your Render app URL at: `https://your-app.onrender.com/run-updates`
2. This will create the tables in the PostgreSQL database
3. Then test the forms:
