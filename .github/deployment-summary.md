## Deployment Status

‚úÖ **Code Deployed:** Pushed to GitHub, Render auto-deploying  
‚è≥ **Database Migrations:** Manual application required  
‚úÖ **Navigation:** Complete and functional  
‚úÖ **Session Timeout:** Active immediately after deployment  
‚è≥ **Bulk Products:** Requires database migration to function  
‚úÖ **Quick Wins:** Functional (uses existing commercial_lead_requests table)  
‚úÖ **AI Proposal Generator:** Functional with placeholder content  

---

## Support & Maintenance

### Known Limitations
- AI proposal generation uses template-based placeholders (ready for AI API integration)
- Quality checks display badges but don't perform actual checks (ready for API integration)
- Download buttons (Word, PDF) need file generation libraries
- Bulk products requires database migration before use

### Performance Considerations
- Quick Wins pagination set to 12 leads per page
- Bulk Products pagination set to 12 requests per page
- All tables indexed on filter columns for performance
- Session timeout checks on every request (minimal overhead)

### Security Notes
- Session timeout enforces inactivity logout
- All sensitive contact info behind paywall
- SQL parameterized queries prevent injection
- Admin email bypass for testing purposes

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor Render deployment logs
2. Apply database migrations to production
3. Test all new features
4. Consider AI API integration for enhanced proposal generation
5. Implement document download functionality (Word, PDF)
