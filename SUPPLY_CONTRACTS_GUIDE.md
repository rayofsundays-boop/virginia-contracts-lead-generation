## ðŸš€ How to Deploy

### Step 1: Test Locally First

```bash
# Make sure you're in your project directory
cd "/Users/chinneaquamatthews/Lead Generartion for Cleaning Contracts (VA) ELITE"

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run migration on local SQLite database
sqlite3 leads.db < migrations/create_supply_contracts.sql

# Verify the data
sqlite3 leads.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supply_contracts;"
# Expected: 16

sqlite3 leads.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supply_contracts WHERE is_quick_win = 1;"
# Expected: 14

# View sample contracts
sqlite3 leads.db "SELECT title, agency, product_category, estimated_value FROM supply_contracts LIMIT 5;"
```

### Step 2: Test the Web Page Locally

```bash
# Start Flask (if not already running)
python app.py

# Visit in browser:
# http://127.0.0.1:8080/supply-contracts
# or
# http://127.0.0.1:8080/supplies
```

**Test these features:**
- âœ… Contracts display in grid layout
- âœ… Quick Win badges show on fast-turnaround contracts
- âœ… City filter dropdown works
- âœ… Product category filter works
- âœ… "Quick Wins Only" toggle works
- âœ… "Small Business" toggle works
- âœ… Pagination works
- âœ… Paywall shows for non-subscribers

---

### Step 3: Deploy to Production (Render)

#### 3A. Push Code to GitHub

```bash
# Add all changes
git add -A

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add supply contracts feature - quick wins for product suppliers"

# Push to trigger Render deployment
git push origin main
```

#### 3B. Run Database Migration on Render PostgreSQL

**Option 1: Using Render's Internal Connection (Recommended)**

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on your **PostgreSQL** database (not the web service)
3. Click **"Connect"** button in top right
4. Select **"Internal Connection"** tab
5. Click **"Open Shell"** - opens web-based psql terminal
6. Copy the ENTIRE contents of `migrations/create_supply_contracts.sql`
7. Paste into the shell and press ENTER
8. Wait for it to complete

**Expected Output:**
```
CREATE TABLE
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX
CREATE INDEX
INSERT 0 16
Supply Contracts Created!
total_supply_contracts: 16
quick_wins: 14
small_business_set_asides: 14
```

**Option 2: Using Terminal (if you have psql installed)**

```bash
# Get your Render PostgreSQL connection string from dashboard
# It looks like: PGPASSWORD=xxx psql -h xxx -U xxx xxx

# From your project directory, run:
cat migrations/create_supply_contracts.sql | PGPASSWORD=your_password psql -h your_host -U your_user your_database
```

### Step 4: Verify Production Deployment

#### Check Database:

In Render PostgreSQL shell:

```sql
-- Count total contracts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supply_contracts;
-- Expected: 16

-- Count quick wins
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supply_contracts WHERE is_quick_win = TRUE;
-- Expected: 14

-- View breakdown by city
SELECT location, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM supply_contracts 
GROUP BY location 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- View breakdown by product category
SELECT product_category, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM supply_contracts 
GROUP BY product_category 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Sample 5 contracts
SELECT title, agency, location, estimated_value, bid_deadline 
FROM supply_contracts 
ORDER BY bid_deadline ASC 
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Check Website:

Visit your production URL:
- **Supply Contracts Page**: `your-app.onrender.com/supply-contracts`
- Test all filters: City, Category, Quick Wins, Small Business
- Verify pagination works
- Check paywall for non-subscribers
- Test subscriber access (if you have a paid account)

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Table already exists" error
- Safe to ignore - the migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Data will still be inserted

### "Duplicate key violation" error
- Data might already be there
- Run: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supply_contracts;` to verify

### Contracts not showing on website
1. Check Render logs for your web service
2. Verify migration completed successfully: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM supply_contracts;`
3. Check that web service redeployed after Git push
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### Filters not working
- Make sure you pushed the updated `app.py` to GitHub
- Verify Render redeployment completed
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
